            <p>The dog or domestic dog, (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated
                descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient,
                extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the
                first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the
                development of agriculture.[1]

                Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
                individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
                other canids.[11] Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
                human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[12]

                The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
                physical attributes.[13] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for
                humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
                companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the
                sobriquet of "man's best friend." .</p>
